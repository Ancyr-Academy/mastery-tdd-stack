![image](https://cdn.programiz.com/sites/tutorial2program/files/stack.png)

Implement a simple [stack data-structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type)) with the following features :
- adding an element
- popping an element
- peeking the top element
- getting the size of the stack

Think behaviorally.
